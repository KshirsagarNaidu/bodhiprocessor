# BodhiProcessor
This project is based on the Crowducate Meteor App (http://crowducate.me).

Overview of the BodhiProcessor Platform
===========
BodhiProcessor is an platform for cataloging study resources currently aimed for Indian students. Resources can be; question papers, self-evaluation quizzes, courses and lessons, video explanation of concepts, etc...

BodhiProcessor also plans to address other students of the world through a generic view of the content, by the way of geo-specific UI elements (eg: 'Grade' instead of 'Standard' for North-American countries), a layout/format that can be easily understood by many students. However, targeting India itself is a challenge due to it's various education boards (eg: [CBSE](http://cbse.nic.in/), [ICSE](http://www.cisce.org/), [KCET](http://kea.kar.nic.in/), etc...)

Goals
============
* UI similar and inspired by Coursera.
* The content will be classified by 'standards', 'subject', 'courses', 'lessons'. Lessons fall under the Courses, and courses and lessons will have study material such as 'quizzes', 'question papers', etc...
* A reliable and useful app/platform for students to find what they want concerning their course materials, in a easily accessible way.
* Forums support (most likely will be a seperate plugin module).
* Support for various roles, eg: student, teacher, admin, etc...
* User generated content by approved people. Eg: We can have teachers create a course for their students, where the students will get an invitation to join the course. The course is exclusive to the said student. The teacher can create lessons, course content, sample question papers, etc...
