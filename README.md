# BodhiProcessor
This project is based on the Crowducate Meteor App (http://crowducate.me).

Overview of the BodhiProcessor Platform
===========
BodhiProcessor is an platform for cataloging study resources currently aimed at Indian students. Resources can be; question papers, self-evaluation quizzes, courses and lessons, video explanation of concepts, etc...

BodhiProcessor also plans to address other students of the world through a generic view of the content, a layout/format that can be easily understood by many students. However, targeting India itself is a challenge due to it's various education boards (eg: [CBSE](http://cbse.nic.in/), [ICSE](http://www.cisce.org/), [KCET](http://kea.kar.nic.in/), etc...)
